module type S = sig
  (** Abstraction for irmin-pack's append only files (i.e. suffix and dict).

      It is parameterized with [Io], a file system abstraction (e.g. unix,
      mirage, eio_linux).

      It comprises a persistent file, an append buffer and take care of
      automatically shifting offsets to deal with legacy headers. *)

  module Io : Io.S

  type t

  val create_rw :
    path:string ->
    overwrite:bool ->
    auto_flush_threshold:int ->
    auto_flush_callback:(unit -> unit) ->
    (t, [> Io.create_error ]) result
  (** Create a rw instance of [t] by creating the file. *)

  val open_rw :
    path:string ->
    end_offset:int63 ->
    dead_header_size:int ->
    auto_flush_threshold:int ->
    auto_flush_callback:(unit -> unit) ->
    (t, [> Io.open_error ]) result
  (** Create a rw instance of [t] by opening an existing file at [path].

      {3 End Offset}

      The file has an end offset at which new data will be saved. While this
      information could be computed by looking at the size of the file, we
      prefer storing that information elsewhere (i.e. in the control file). This
      is why [open_rw] and [open_ro] take an [end_offset] parameter, and also
      why [refresh_end_offset] exists. The abstractions above [Append_only_file]
      are responsible for reading/writing the offsets from/to the control file.

      {3 [dead_header_size]}

      Designates a small area at the beginning of the file that should be
      ignored. The offsets start after that area.

      The actual persisted size of a file is [end_offset + dead_header_size].

      This concept exists in order to keep supporting [`V1] and [`V2] pack
      stores with [`V3].

      {3 Auto Flushes}

      One of the goal of the [Append_only_file] abstraction is to provide
      buffered appends. [auto_flush_threshold] is the soft cap after which the
      buffer should be flushed. If a call to [append_exn] fills the buffer,
      [auto_flush_callback] will be called so that the parent abstraction takes
      care of the flush procedure. *)

  val open_ro :
    path:string ->
    end_offset:int63 ->
    dead_header_size:int ->
    (t, [> Io.open_error ]) result
  (** Create a ro instance of [t] by opening an existing file at [path] *)

  val close : t -> (unit, [> Io.close_error | `Pending_flush ]) result
  (** Close the underlying file.

      The internal buffer is expected to be in a flushed state when [close] is
      called. Otherwise, an error is returned. *)

  val end_offset : t -> int63
  (** [end_offset t] is the number of bytes of the file. That function doesn't
      perform IO.

      {3 RW mode}

      It also counts the bytes not flushed yet. However, it is then not valid to use the
      result in a call to [refresh_end_offset] on an RO instance. TODO it is likely an
      error to call this when the buffer is not empty.

      {3 RO mode}

      This information originates from the latest reload of the control file.
      Calling [refresh_end_offset t] updates [end_offset]. *)

  val read_to_string :
    t -> off:int63 -> len:int -> (string, [> Io.read_error ]) result

  val read_exn : t -> off:int63 -> len:int -> bytes -> unit
  (** [read_exn t ~off ~len b] puts the [len] bytes of [t] at [off] to [b].

      Raises [Io.Read_error]

      {3 RW mode}

      Attempting to read from the append buffer results in an
      [`Read_out_of_bounds] error. This feature could easily be implemented in
      the future if ever needed. It was not needed with io_legacy.

      {3 RO mode}

      It is not possible to read from an offset further than [end_offset t]. *)

  val append_exn : t -> string -> unit
  (** [append_exn t ~off b] writes [b] to the end of [t]. Might trigger an auto
      flush.

      Post-condition: [end_offset t - end_offset (old t) = String.length b].

      Raises [Io.Write_error]

      {3 RW mode}

      Always raises [Io.Write_error `Ro_not_allowed] *)

  val flush : t -> (unit, [> Io.write_error ]) result
  (** Flush the append buffer. Does not call [fsync].

      {3 RO mode}

      Always returns [Error `Ro_not_allowed]. *)

  val fsync : t -> (unit, [> Io.write_error ]) result
  (** Tell the os to fush its internal buffers. Does not call [flush].

      {3 RO mode}

      Always returns [Error `Ro_not_allowed]. *)

  val refresh_end_offset : t -> int63 -> (unit, [> `Rw_not_allowed ]) result
  (** Ingest the new end offset of the file.

      {3 RO mode}

      When calling [refresh_end_offset t off], the RO instance requires that the end
      offset bytes are present on disk. So we cannot just call [end_offset] in the RW
      instance and use this for [refresh_end_offset]; instead, we must first make sure the
      RW instance buffer is empty (by calling flush), and then call [end_offset] to
      retrieve the offset, which is then safe for RO instances.

      {3 RW mode}

      Always returns [Error `Rw_not_allowed]. *)
